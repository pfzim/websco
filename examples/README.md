[This script](_TEMPLATE_Runbook_Git.ps1) is designed to **run and process the results of a PowerShell script (runbook)** in an automated manner. It performs the following tasks:

---

### 1. **Runbook Execution**
- The script runs another PowerShell script (runbook), the path to which is specified in the `$rb_input.runbook_file` variable.
- Input parameters for the runbook are passed via the `$rb_input` hashtable.

---

### 2. **Runbook Result Processing**
- After executing the runbook, the script checks the result:
  - It expects the runbook to return a hashtable (`Hashtable`) with the following keys:
    - `errors` — errors that occurred during execution.
    - `warnings` — warnings.
    - `messages` — informational messages.
  - If the result does not match the expected format, the script throws an exception.

---

### 3. **Error Handling**
- If the runbook fails or returns invalid data, the script:
  - Logs the error, including the line number, error message, and runbook output.
  - Throws an exception with detailed information.

---

### 4. **Debugging and Logging**
- The script supports a debugging mode (`$DebugPreference`), which can be configured via the `debug_pref` parameter.
- At the end, the script outputs debug information about errors, warnings, and messages.

---

### Use Case Examples:
This script can be part of an automation system, such as:
- **Orchestrator** (e.g., Azure Automation, System Center Orchestrator).
- **CI/CD pipelines**, where the runbook is used for tasks like deployment, infrastructure configuration, or data processing.
- **Infrastructure monitoring and management**, where the runbook performs checks or fixes.

---

### Key Parameters:
- **runbook_file** — the path to the runbook file to be executed.
- **example_param1**, **example_param2** — example input parameters for the runbook.
- **ps_server**, **ps_user**, **ps_passwd** — parameters for connecting to a server (e.g., for executing remote commands).
- **debug_pref** — the level of debugging detail (e.g., `SilentlyContinue` or `Continue`).

---

### Summary:
This script is a **wrapper for running and processing runbook results**. It provides:
- Standardized runbook execution.
- Error and warning handling.
- Logging and debugging for easier issue diagnosis.
